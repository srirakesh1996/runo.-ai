             Beyond Cloud Technology:

                     Cloud telephony solved the problems of the past, but sales has moved on. Personalised outreach is the future. Customers want to see a real number, talk to a real person, and trust who’s calling. Masked or landline numbers make your calls feel robotic and impersonal. SIM-based calling builds that trust, which is why many teams already use it, but they often lack a proper CRM to track leads and manage

                     performance, thinking cloud telephony is the only way to get there. Runo bridges this gap. It combines SIM-based calling with a powerful CRM that’s built for modern sales teams. You get better call connect rates, clear visibility, and a sales process your team will actually follow, without needing cloud telephony. This isn’t a workaround. It’s a new category built for how sales should work today.
