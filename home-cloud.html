          Cloud telephony solved the problems of the past, but sales has moved
          on. Personalised outreach is the future. Customers want to see a real
          number, talk to a real person, and trust who’s calling. Masked or
          landline numbers make your calls feel robotic and impersonal.
          SIM-based calling builds that trust, which is why many teams already
          use it, but they often lack a proper CRM to track leads and manage

          performance, thinking cloud telephony is the only way to get there.
          Runo bridges this gap. It combines SIM-based calling with a powerful
          CRM that’s built for modern sales teams. You get better call connect
          rates, clear visibility, and a sales process your team will actually
          follow, without needing cloud telephony. This isn’t a workaround. It’s
          a new category built for how sales should work today.
